About
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Gambatte is a work-in-progress, portable, open-source, Game Boy Color emulator,
and reverse engineering project, written with a wish to preserve something. The
development of numerous tests, and their verification on hardware, is as much an
emphasis as the development of an efficient software implementation.

(Extensive test coverage is seen as necessary to verify the accuracy of an
efficient software implementation. The preservation aspect of the project is
emphasised by the development of verified tests to support the development, and
verification, of accurate implementations. Note that the source code is not
intended to serve as documentation for the hardware being emulated; efficiency
and convenience are often emphasised.)

The core emulation code is contained in a separate library backend
(libgambatte) written in platform-independent C++. There is currently a Qt GUI
frontend (gambatte_qt), and a simplistic command-line interface SDL frontend
(gambatte_sdl).

The Qt frontend has been ported to Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux/BSD/Unix-like
OSes with audio/video engines utilizing native APIs on these platforms.

The SDL frontend should be usable on all platforms with a working SDL port. It
should also be quite trivial to create new (simple) frontends (note that the
library API should in no way be considered stable).

Usage
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You will have to supply Gambatte with a ROM image file of the GB/GBC
program/game you would like to run/play, either as a command line argument, or
through the File->Open... menu in gambatte_qt.

gambatte_sdl keyboard commands:
TAB    - fast-forward
Ctrl-f - toggle full screen
Ctrl-r - reset
F5     - save state
F6     - previous state slot
F7     - next state slot
F8     - load state
0 to 9 - select state slot 0 to 9

Default key mapping:
Up:     Up
Down:   Down
Left:   Left
Right:  Right
A:      D
B:      C
Start:  Return
Select: Shift

Compiling
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Building Gambatte from source code can be done by executing the
build_<qt/sdl>.sh scripts for the qt/sdl frontends respectively, or by issueing
the correct build command (either 'scons' or 'qmake && make') in the top-level
subdirectories (libgambatte will have to be built first). The clean.sh script
can be executed to remove all generated files after a compile (including
binaries).

Requirements for building libgambatte:
- A decent C++ compiler (like g++ in the GNU Compiler Collection).
- SCons.
- optionally zlib

Requirements for building gambatte_sdl:
- A decent C++ compiler (like g++ in the GNU Compiler Collection).
- SDL headers and library.
- SCons.
(- libgambatte.)

Requirements for building gambatte_qt:
- A decent C++ compiler (like g++ in the GNU Compiler Collection).
- Qt4 (Core, GUI, OpenGL) headers and library.
- Qmake and make (GNU Make should work).
- Platform-specific requirements:
  * MS Windows:
    - Win32 API headers and libraries.
    - DirectSound and DirectDraw7 headers and libraries.
    - Direct3D9 headers
  * Linux/BSD/UNIX-like OSes:
    - POSIX/UNIX headers (unistd.h, fcntl.h, sys/ioctl.h, sys/time.h, sys/shm.h).
    - Open Sound System header (sys/soundcard.h).
    - X11 Xlib, XVideo, XRandR and XShm headers and libraries.
    - Alsa headers and library (Linux only).
  * Max OS X:
    - Recent Mac OS X SDK (Panther Xcode/SDK should work)
(- libgambatte.)

Installing after a compile simply amounts to copying the generated binary
(either gambatte_qt/bin/gambatte_qt<.exe> or gambatte_sdl/gambatte_sdl<.exe>)
to wherever you'd like to keep it.
